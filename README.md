# Impact of GW lensing on the neutron star mass distribution

Mock catalogues of events used in https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11480. 

For each mass distribution, 10 independent realisations of $10^5$ events are avalilable, except for the Gaussian case with mmaz=2.5 for which 20 realisations are available.

redshifts 
and lensing magnifications {𝑧,𝜇} of the events are made available, together with a short script to plot the data. 

The mock data are relevant for gravitational waves emitted by merging binary neutron stars measured by the **Einstein Telescope**, 
assuming a threshold for the signal-to-noise ratio of **8**.
